# Compliance and Regulatory Tools

This directory contains the implementation of compliance and regulatory tools for the project, focusing on KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) measures.

## KYC (Know Your Customer)

The KYC process is implemented in the `kyc/verify.js` file, which contains the logic for verifying user identities to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

## AML (Anti-Money Laundering)

The AML measures are implemented in the `aml/monitor.js` file, which monitors and analyzes transactions to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.

## Usage

Ensure that the KYC and AML processes are integrated into the user onboarding and transaction processes to maintain compliance with applicable regulations.
