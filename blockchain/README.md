# Blockchain Integration Documentation

This directory contains the components related to the blockchain integration of the project.

## Contracts

The `contracts` directory includes the smart contracts written in Solidity. These contracts define the logic and rules for the decentralized applications.

- **MyContract.sol**: This is the main smart contract for the project.

## Scripts

The `scripts` directory may contain scripts for deploying or interacting with the smart contracts. Ensure to include any necessary deployment scripts or utilities here.

## Getting Started

To work with the blockchain components, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Truffle or Hardhat for compiling and deploying smart contracts.
- A local Ethereum node or access to a test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten).

## Deployment

To deploy the smart contracts, navigate to the `scripts` directory and run the appropriate deployment script using Truffle or Hardhat.

## Testing

Make sure to write tests for your smart contracts to ensure their functionality and security. Use the testing framework provided by Truffle or Hardhat.
