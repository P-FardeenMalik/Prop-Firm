# API Integration Documentation

This document provides an overview of the API integration for the project, specifically focusing on the CoinAPI service.

## Overview

The API layer of the project is designed to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, as well as to integrate with external services such as CoinAPI. This allows for efficient data retrieval and transaction processing.

## CoinAPI Integration

### Description

CoinAPI is a unified cryptocurrency API that provides access to real-time and historical market data from various cryptocurrency exchanges. The integration with CoinAPI allows the application to fetch market prices, execute trades, and monitor account balances.

### File Structure

- `coinAPI.js`: Contains the logic for connecting to the CoinAPI service, handling requests, and processing responses.

### Usage

To use the CoinAPI integration, ensure that you have the necessary API keys and configurations set up in your environment. The `coinAPI.js` file includes functions for:

- Fetching market data
- Executing trades
- Monitoring account balances

### Setup

1. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install axios
   ```

2. Configure your API keys in the environment variables or directly in the `coinAPI.js` file (not recommended for production).

3. Import the CoinAPI functions in your backend services or controllers as needed.

### Example

Here is a basic example of how to fetch market data using the CoinAPI integration:

```javascript
const { getMarketData } = require('./coinAPI');

async function fetchMarketData() {
    try {
        const data = await getMarketData();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching market data:', error);
    }
}

fetchMarketData();
```

## Conclusion

This API integration provides a robust foundation for interacting with cryptocurrency markets, enhancing the functionality of the application. For further details, refer to the comments and documentation within the `coinAPI.js` file.
