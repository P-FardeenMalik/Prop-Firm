# Security Measures Documentation

This directory contains the security measures implemented in the project to ensure the safety and integrity of user data and transactions.

## SSL/TLS Encryption
- The `ssl` directory contains the SSL certificate (`cert.pem`) and the private key (`key.pem`) used to secure data transmission between users and the platform.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- The `2fa` directory includes the `setup.js` file, which contains the logic for implementing two-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of security to user accounts.

## DDoS Protection
- Measures are in place to safeguard the platform against distributed denial-of-service attacks, ensuring availability and reliability.

## Wallet Management
- Multi-signature wallets are utilized to enhance the security of user funds by requiring multiple approvals for transactions.
- Cold storage solutions are implemented to store the majority of funds offline, protecting against online threats.
